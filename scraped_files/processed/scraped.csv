Lakshmi’s work with elite sports teams, like the Indian Cricket team, and Amol’s entrepreneurial run is what brought the duo together. Lami.Fit (lami.fit) is the perfect example of what happens when intuition, knowledge, experience and technology come together. The first-of-its-kind healthtech platform that uses DNA, and blood & body markers to predict health risks, Lami.fit synthesises the findings to curate personalised health plans that can prevent and reverse lifestyle diseases like diabetes, thyroid, PCOS, heart risks & chronic gut disorders. This app isn’t just great news for those of us with a sedentary lifestyle – it also helps athletes & individuals to reach the peak of their health and fitness. The makers of the app believe that every individual is different and that the nutritional and fitness requirements for people vary greatly. A general nutrition plan can only do so much and does not have the ability to fundamentally solve underlying health problems. Lakshmi recalls her first success that led to Lami.Fit’s birth. She had recommended a few dietary changes to her partner’s father who was dealing with diabetes, and in no time there was a substantial improvement in his condition. Not only did his dependency on medicines reduce, but his overall health improved as well. That was the moment when Lakshmi decided to make her experience accessible to all. A partnership with Amol, who brought an entrepreneurial mindset, cleared the stage for Lami.Fit’s launch. The support from I-win has helped Lakshmi and Amol a great deal. Having mentors and programs that hand-hold at each step where guidance is required was invaluable to Lami.Fit’s journey. The founders believe that the “Strategically structured program” added value to the product and to the marketing as well. As Lami.Fit grows month on month, we wish the founders good luck in their endeavours to take health and fitness to every smartphone user! This is one of the sixteen stories to introduce you to the current cohort of start-ups being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB’s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups. # I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs          							Previous Post 								[I-WIN Startup Stories] Discover how Saumita Banerjee is enabling authors with LetsAuthor							  							Next Post 								[I-WIN Startup Stories] How Lochan helps individuals deal with their career related dilemmas.

This will allow Indian startups to pursue business opportunities in other countries and vice versa. It also is looking to draft its alumni members as mentors to nurture startup ideas into scalable businesses, said Prof Bhagwan Chowdhry, Faculty Director, I-Venture, which fosters entrepreneurship and nurtures startups at ISB. It administers business incubators and facilitates the conversion of startups into entrepreneurial ventures. It has various programmes that cater to ventures of all stages. “We have stepped up activities related to nurturing the entrepreneurship ecosystem. We were doing them in pockets. Now, we are bringing them under one umbrella. We are engaging with alumni members asking them to don the hats of mentors,” he said. ISB has more than 13,000 alumni members in 60-plus countries. “The success or the failure of the startups is not just decided by the idea but also by the team executing it. Our alumni members will nurture ideas into successful businesses. I think the alumni network is the biggest source of brain power. They will do the hand-holding,” he said. Depending on ideas, alumni members, who might be latent entrepreneurs, may opt to turn co-founders in the ventures. On the approach that ISB will take, he said ideas will be matched with the alumni members for taking it forward. It is also making efforts to work with other entrepreneurship ecosystem players and educational institutions. The focus is on hosting startup activities jointly and also bringing teams together,” said Chowdhry. I-Venture “There might be students in India where they have an idea but see their use cases in Europe, the US or other countries. Many budding entrepreneurs may not be aware of the legal system in those countries, the startup ecosystem there or finding the right mentors there. Conversely, there might be ideas in other countries that can solve a problem in India. We will play a bridge to connect ideas with local players, policymakers and others,” he told Telangana Today. ISB will work with the venture capital funding community and external funding agencies. ISB has also been seeing some startups coming to the campus placement drives for recruitment. “Business proliferations happen when the markets are hot. There will be some shocks when the economy is not doing good. That is the nature of entrepreneurship. All the startups will not succeed. However, we should continue to allow experimentation to happen. There will be upswings, shocks, and closures and those that survive will be more robust. There are some job losses happening now. They all are talented people. They will find work with other startups or companies,” he said about the recent job losses in the startups. ISB is also doing an entrepreneurship programme under CM ST Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CMSTEI) scheme to support and promote entrepreneurs among scheduled tribes of Telangana. The Tribal Cooperative Finance Corporation (TRICOR) is the primary stakeholder in this programme. \I-Venture\ More than 170 startups graduated 70 raised funding Total funding raised by startups is about Rs 730 crore More than 2,000 jobs created by startups          							Previous Post 								The Atal Catalysts @ ISB program helps 10 young innovators transform into digipreneurs							  							Next Post 								I-Connect @ISB: Creating an ecosystem for entrepreneurs to network							  Newsletter Updates 				Enter your email address below to subscribe to our newsletter			  I accept the Privacy Policy 				Subscribe			  Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

The company, which was then making uniforms, had to shut down. And with it, the dreams of 91 women who were being rehabilitated by Sonia’s company were also on the verge of shutting down. To Sonia’s trained mind, it was only the start of challenges. An alumnus of ISB herself, she wasted no time in restarting Monk & Mei out of the garage in her home with just one Karigar (skilled artisan), where Masterjis (experienced cutters) used to come, pick up the fabric, make garments and deliver them. There was no looking back from here. Today Monk & Mei (monkandmei.com) is an indo-western luxury women’s wear brand that is both affordable and responsible. In just 500 days, the brand has cultivated an organic following of more than 15 thousand women and 250-plus celebrities/influencers. All this has happened, like Sonia says, because of its strong team of 20-plus designers, merchandisers, community builders, and skilled craftswomen and men. Not only is it among one of the top sellers in several categories on Nykaa Fashion, but garments from Monk & Mei can also be bought off Myntra for Earth, Tata IndiLuxe and it’s now even catering to the NRI market through Pernia’s Pop-Up Shop. The initial success of the Odisha initiative inspired Sonia to create a designer brand that is both responsible, and conscious; one which helps build a cleaner, greener, and more inclusive planet. Through their efforts, the good people at Monk & Mei have distributed 15,000 seed tags, 7500 jute bags, and 15,000 masks. That, along with the employment it generates for rural artisans, makes Monk & Mei a truly sensitive brand. Sonia feels that being incubated through the I-Win program made their way of working even more structured. They connected with the right people to resolve the right challenges which helped them address some of their core problem areas. Monk & Mei has accomplished in 500 days what few brands can do. We wish the whole team more power to achieve their goals for the next 500! This is one of the the sixteen startups in the current cohort being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB’s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups. I-Venture@ ISB is proud to take them through our I-WIN Accelerator program and we wish the venture a successful journey! # I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs          							Previous Post 								I-Venture @ ISB portfolio startup WABS-Without A Break was featured in WoW!

I-Connect was organised by I-Venture @ISB in partnership with Kalaari Capital, Endiya Partners and T-Hub at the ISB Hyderabad campus.  The lead up to the networking dinner saw the I-Venture team holding discussions with Kalaari Capital and Endiya Partners, followed by a few startups incubated by I-Venture @ISB making presentations to the VCs. Welcoming the attendees, Professor Bhagwan Chowdhry, Faculty Director, I-Venture @ISB, said that the goal is to exchange ideas and make connections. “This is first of the many such events,” he said. Ms Vani Kola, Managing Director, Kalaari Capital; Mr Sateesh Andra, Managing Director, Endiya Partners; Mr Harkesh Mittal, Chairman, Startup India Seed Fund Committee; and Professor Madan Pillutla, Dean, ISB shared their insights at I-Connect@ISB. Speaking at the event, Dean Madan Pillutla said, “At ISB, we are creating an ecosystem to connect individuals and incubators which would not only help them, but also contribute to the nation’s growth.”   Ms Vani Kola said, “ISB has very special role to play. There’s a time and a place for what we can do in India in encouraging and exploring entrepreneurship to create meaningful value, not only for India but to be a beacon across the globe in the kind of the companies we create.” Mr Harkesh Mittal expressed that he sees a wonderful future as this is the time to be in India. “This is the time to be a startup, to be an investor and continue to be a startup ecosystem,” he said. The event saw participation of start-up founders, venture capitalists, incubator representatives, government officials, students, and ISB faculty.  For Ashwin and Sandesh, founders of Ergon Mobility Private Limited- a startup incubated by D-Labs at ISB- attending the event was an ‘exhilarating’ experience. “Meeting industry leaders and seasoned entrepreneurs was definitely the key point of the event,” said Sandesh. Two food start-ups- Wabs and Pro Dough- incubated by D-Labs had put up stalls at the event to showcase their products.

This resulted in a Sales role but at every crucial point in her career, Lochan continued to seek clarity and support. She tried to answer the question – ‘What should I do next?’ but in the absence of any customized guidance, she ended up taking generic career advice. In 2019, when she started working as a career coach, she realized that there were a whole lot of other professionals like herself who had faced similar dilemmas at different times in their career. That is what led to the genesis of OfExperiences, a platform that builds, develops and equips professionals who are undergoing career transitions by running niche cohort-based programs for them across career stages, and providing them with relevant information, personalized guidance, and real connections to help them navigate through their transitional phase. OFExperiences also acts as a bridge between such professionals and organizations that are looking for similar talent. Not only does Lochan’s brainchild help organizations with ready talent, but they also provide valuable behavioural insights that enable the organization’s talent hiring and development efforts. For Lochan, giving shape to her dream has not been as easy as getting the idea itself. It took some time to design the right business model and several experiments, market explorations and positioning exercises to get to the root of it all. While building awareness is a recurring challenge, I-WIN’s accelerator program has provided a unique combination of workshops, mentors and networking opportunities. Lochan feels that the network with other startups has been very encouraging and has opened up conversations for potential collaborations. We hope Lochan and OFExperiences can capitalize on each opportunity that comes their way!

When co-founders Anagha Kulkarni and Diwakar Badiger came together, it was no surprise that they hit upon the idea of Careerboat – Diwakar had worked with more than 5 EdTech companies since his first year in Engineering, and Anagha had worked with more than 3 since hers. Careerboat, therefore came most organically to this young and dynamic duo. The pandemic had hit students hard in 2020. Many of them had been on the cusp of change but life plans suddenly had to be re-looked at. Being students themselves, Diwakar and Anagha understood the pain points of other students. Even after enrolling for virtual courses and attending online Bootcamps, students felt confused, stuck and unable to decide what to do next. Many would lose motivation after receiving their certifications.  That’s how Careerboat came into existence. The co-founders of Careerboat were quick to see that students’ demands were changing and they wanted to succeed and build career identities. However, they needed support to get through the difficult times. Careerboat was created to meet exactly these changing needs. With offerings as interesting as ‘mentor match making’ and curated learning resources, Careerboat ensures that its users have a clear career roadmap. Careerboat users have unlimited touch points with their mentors who guide them and even provide job referrals. Users can build their personal portfolios by connecting with the top 1% of mentors in their industry. Not surprisingly, the lack of dependable mentorship was a challenge that the founders themselves faced in the beginning. The start-up ecosystem was not new, but being founders came with its own responsibilities. With their keen determination though, Diwakar and Anagha have scaled several milestones and received backing from as many as four different entities, including one from the Stanford Seed Spark Program. We hope that Careerboat will achieve each goal they’ve set for themselves! This is one of the sixteen stories to introduce you to the current cohort of start-ups being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB’s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups. # I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs          							Previous Post 								[I-WIN Startup Stories] How Lochan helps individuals deal with their career related dilemmas.

It was set up as a platform for authors to collaborate with peers and co-author books. Its founder, Saumita Banerjee envisioned the start-up as one that empowers authors to bring their ideas to life. At LetsAuthor, the authors come from various walks of life, and also from across continents. The team strives toward publishing books to high editorial and production standards. LetsAuthor publishes in the areas of popular science; business & management; mind, body & spirit; lifestyle; general non-fiction, as well as in fiction (short stories and anthologies), and books for children and young adults. Quite a diverse list of subjects for a publishing house that is still in its start-up phase. But this diversity is only a reflection of Saumita’s own diverse interests. She is an Entrepreneur and a technology enthusiast with experience across Industrial R&D, Technology Analysis, and more recently, Book Publishing. Saumita is an ME, PhD in Biotechnology and is an alumnus of premiere Indian institutes BITS Pilani and IIT Kharagpur. A chance conversation that Saumita had with the CEO of a leading Open Innovation company is how the seeds of LetsAuthor were sown. He had spent years working in the area of innovation and had a lot to share. He wanted to write a book but what he didn’t have was the time to write the entire book all by himself. Like the name of the company suggests, Saumita decided to turn writing from a solitary pursuit into a collaborative exercise. Today over 80 authors are collaborating to write their books on the ‘LetsAuthor’ platform, with constant support from their Commissioning Editors, and their Community Manager. The publishing house currently has 15 books at various stages of development. More authors are signing up for the platform every day, thus validating the idea and the need that Saumita had articulated. Recounting her journey with the I-Win program, Saumita shares that she’s learnt valuable lessons on running a business enterprise. She loved going back to the classroom and cementing her ideas more fruitfully than self-learning would’ve done for her. Saumita and LetsAuthor deserve amazing success and we wish them just that! This is one of the the sixteen startups in the current cohort being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB’s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups. # I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs          							Previous Post 								[I-WIN Startup Stories] What led Sonia Khatri Anand to build a global brand from the brink of shutdown							  							Next Post 								[I-WIN Startup Stories] In a world where fitness is measured by weight alone, Lami.Fit stands out by a mile							  Newsletter Updates 				Enter your email address below to subscribe to our newsletter			  I accept the Privacy Policy 				Subscribe			  Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

The Tinkerpreneur bootcamp was a first of its kind initiative by AIM to teach students entrepreneurship during the summer break. Students learnt various skills such as latest technology skills, building a product, business models, marketing, branding, business finance, building an online store and finally how to pitch their venture. ATL Tinkerpreneur witnessed participation from over 9000 students and leveraged the knowledge and hands-on involvement of over 650 Mentors of Change to build a complete digital business venture at the end of the bootcamp. The Top 100 Students/teams were mapped to ISB to nurture their ideas further. I-Venture @ ISB, which fosters all entrepreneurial activities for the Institution and nurtures start-ups, took over the charge of developing, designing and executing the 2nd stage of the students’ journey towards becoming entrepreneurs. Since then, the students/teams with the 100 most promising ideas have gone through a variety of Masterclasses and mentoring sessions that have added value to them and to their products. No less than six Masterclasses were conducted, each of them taught using case studies and real-world examples. The topics covered a wide range:  1. Entrepreneurial Ecosystem & Mindset 2. Competitor Analysis & Market Research 3. Idea Validation, Product or Idea Development 4. Digital Marketing & Branding 5. Finance & HR 6. Investor Pitch & Pitching Techniques While the Masterclasses added to the knowledge base of the students, the highlight of their journey at Atal Catalysts @ ISB was the customized mentoring experience that was curated for each of them. More than 65 mentors were part of the program, each of them an alumnus of ISB. Each of them came from different backgrounds and fields and brought different capabilities with them. The Atal Catalysts @ ISB team carefully analysed the areas of improvement for every idea and mapped it to the expertise of the right mentor. This ensured that the students got the most appropriate guidance they needed to enhance their product and develop the necessary entrepreneurial/business skills. The mentoring sessions were conducted one-on-one so that they provided personalized attention to each of the students/teams. Once the products and pitches were refined, the difficult task of selecting the most promising ideas began. The Big Pitch, an event where the teams showcased their ideas to a panel, was conducted over two weekends. The sponsors at The Big Pitch were I-Venture @ ISB, PKF Sridhar & Santhanam, and Prasad Medikonda. The panellist said that they had a tough time shortlisting 10 out of the 20 ideas pitched. With the sponsorships, the selected students/teams will work on developing the app or website before taking them to market. These are the 10 most promising ideas that emerged from The Big Pitch: Press Release: https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1827009          							Next Post 								The Atal Catalysts @ ISB program helps 10 young innovators transform into digipreneurs							  Newsletter Updates 				Enter your email address below to subscribe to our newsletter			  I accept the Privacy Policy 				Subscribe			  Leave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.
